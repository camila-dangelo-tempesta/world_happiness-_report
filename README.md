# **World Happiness Report**

## Exploratory Data Analysis Socioeconomic

The first World Happiness Report was published in April 2012 in support of the UN High Level Meeting on Happiness and Well-Being.
Since then, the world has come a long way. More and more, happiness is considered the adequate measure of social progress and the objective of public policies. 
In June 2016, the OECD committed to “resetting the growth narrative to put people's well-being at the heart of governments' efforts”. 
In February 2017, the UAE held a full-day meeting on World Happiness as part of the World Government Summit. 
Now, on World Happiness Day, March 20, we launch the World Happiness Report 2017, once again at the United Nations, republished by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, and now supported by a generous three-year grant from the Ernesto Foundation Illy.

regions, cities and countries, the influence of indicators on customers' purchasing decisions and how changes in the scenario can impact corporate strategies.
In this project, exploratory analysis techniques will be applied to data real socioeconomic data available publicly.
Since they are real data, they present various problems which are then addressed in the cleaning process prior to analysis.


For this analysis, the data will be reorganized using an interesting change of perspective of the data. 
Then 5 business questions will be answered through graphics and statistics:

* **Question 1:** Increasing a country's GDP per capita positively affects life expectancy of citizens at birth? What is the correlation between these two variables?

* **Question 2:** Is there a correlation between life scale and general public awareness about corruption in business and government? What is the correlation between these two variables?

* **Question 3:** Does the increase in the life scale have any effect on average happiness among the public? generally? What is the correlation between these two variables?

* **Question 4:** The country with the lowest social support index has the highest perception of corruption in in relation to companies and government in the country
